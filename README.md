# Hyvve Backend - Data Collection Platform

## Overview

Hyvve is a data collection platform designed to help users create, manage, and analyze campaigns for various types of data contributions. The backend services power the management of campaigns, contributions, and analytics. **Importantly, our backend acts as a mirror for our onchain dataâ€”enhancing performance and enabling complex analytical computations that would otherwise be expensive if executed solely via RPCs.** Despite these optimizations, the Movement chain remains the single source of truth.

## Key Components

### 1. **Campaign Management**
   - **Campaign**: Represents a data collection initiative. Each campaign is defined by parameters such as title, description, data requirements, and budget.
   - **Contribution**: Represents a user's submission to a campaign, which can include text, documents, images, and other data.
   - **Activity**: Tracks campaign and contribution activity. Activity levels are updated based on contribution data and tracked separately for each contribution and overall campaign.

### 2. **Contributions Verification**
   - Users can upload various types of documents (text, images, etc.), which are then processed and verified using AI for accuracy and relevance.
   - The verification process is cached and uses a fairness adjustment to ensure that scores are unbiased.
   - The verification score is stored in Redis for fast access and efficiency.

### 3. **Analytics**
   - The system provides analytics for campaigns and contributors, including:
     - Total contributions
     - Average cost per submission
     - Peak activity hours
     - Top contributors
     - Weekly analytics (submissions and quality score)
     - Leaderboards for global contributions and campaign creators

### 4. **Task Scheduling**
   - **Celery Task**: A Celery task is set up to periodically mark campaigns whose expiration timestamp has passed as inactive. This is executed every 30 minutes.

## Task Scheduling with Celery

Hyvve uses Celery for background task processing. The task **`mark_expired_campaigns_inactive`** runs every 30 minutes to mark campaigns as inactive when their expiration date has passed.

*Note: While our backend optimizes performance and analytical computations by mirroring onchain data, it does not alter the integrity or role of blockchain data. The Movement chain remains the single source of truth for all onchain information.*
